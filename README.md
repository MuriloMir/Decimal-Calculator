# Decimal-Calculator
This is a module written in D which implements functions for you to perform calculations with the decimal number system rather than the binary number system. The idea is to bypass the precision loss that happens as a result of the binary system, with this module you can perform FP math with total precision, even for numbers that are very big or very tiny.

To use it you only need to download it into your source code's folder and import it in your code.
